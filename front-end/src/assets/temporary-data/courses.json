        "overview":"The curriculum of the online MBA in Business Analytics features two parallel tracks - Business Management and Analytics. The curriculum includes thirteen courses on business management, eight courses on statistics and analytics techniques, five electives, and one capstone project. Each course (other than the capstone project) will require approximately 30 hours of learner effort, across a span of 6 weeks. At most, two courses will run in parallel at a time, allowing you to appreciate different subject matters while maintaining a work/life balance. The capstone will require around 50 hours of student effort over 10 weeks. Each course will include some pre-recorded instructor videos, reading material, and practice questions. This will be accompanied with weekly assessments, hands-on assignments, and project work (often in groups) to ensure you will achieve all course-learning objectives. You will have the opportunity to interact with faculty in at least three live sessions per course, where you may seek feedback and clarification.",
